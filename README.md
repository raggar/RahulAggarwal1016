# Hello there, I'm Rahul Aggarwal :wave:

![Hello Word](https://github.com/RahulAggarwal1016/RahulAggarwal1016/blob/master/banner.png)

Thanks for visiting my github profile! I'm a 20 year-old student developer from Vaughan, Ontario who is currently studying software engineering at the University of Waterloo. As of this moment, I am a software engineering intern at Waabi as well as a backend developer at Hack the North. 

I love attending hackathons (taken part in 9 in the past) and enjoy experimenting with new technologies and frameworks. Have a cool idea in mind? Let's have a chat. 
You can contact me via email, **rahulaggarwal1016@gmail.com** or by messaging me on **[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul1016/)**. I look forward to hearing from you!
